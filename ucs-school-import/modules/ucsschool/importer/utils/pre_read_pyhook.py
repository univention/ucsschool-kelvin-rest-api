	Hook that is called before starting to read the input file.

	The base class' :py:meth:`__init__()` provides the following attributes:

	* self.dry_run     # whether hook is executed during a dry-run (1)
	* self.lo          # LDAP connection object (2)
	* self.logger      # Python logging instance
	* self.config      # read-only import configuration

	If multiple hook classes are found, hook functions with higher
	priority numbers run before those with lower priorities. None disables
	a function (no need to remove it / comment it out).

	(1) Hooks are only executed during dry-runs, if the class attribute
	:py:attr:`supports_dry_run` is set to `True` (default is `False`). Hooks
	with `supports_dry_run == True` must not modify LDAP objects.
	Therefore the LDAP connection object self.lo will be a read-only connection
	during a dry-run.
	(2) Read-write cn=admin connection in a real run, read-only cn=admin
	connection during a dry-run.
