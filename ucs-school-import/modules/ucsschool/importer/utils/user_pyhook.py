    Base class for Python based user import hooks.

    When calling methods of ucsschool objects (e.g. ``ImportUser``,
    ``SchoolClass`` etc.) ``self.udm`` must be used instead of
    ``self.lo`` and those methods may have to be used with ``await``.
    Thus hooks methods will be ``async``.
    For example::

            async def post_create(self, user: "ucsschool.models.import_user.ImportUser") -> None:
                    user.firstname = "Sam"
                    awaituser.modify(self.udm)

                    udm_user_obj = await user.get_udm_object(self.udm)
                    udm_user_obj["foo"] = "bar"
                    await udm_user_obj.save()  # UDM REST Client object: "save", not "modify"


    * self.dry_run     # always ``False`` in the context of the Kelvin API
    * self.lo          # LDAP connection object (1)
    * self.logger      # Python logging instance
    * self.udm         # UDM REST Client instance (2)

    If multiple hook classes are found, hook functions with higher
    priority numbers run before those with lower priorities. None disables
    a function (no need to remove it / comment it out).

    (1) Read-write cn=admin LDAP connection, attention: LDAP attributes
            returned by get() and search() are now ``bytes`Â´, not ``str``
    (2) Read-write cn=admin UDM REST API connection, see
            https://udm-rest-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
