    Hook that is called directly after data has been read from CSV/...

    The base class' :py:meth:`__init__()` provides the following attributes:

    * self.dry_run     # whether hook is executed during a dry-run (1)
    * self.lo          # LDAP connection object (2)
    * self.logger      # Python logging instance

    If multiple hook classes are found, hook functions with higher
    priority numbers run before those with lower priorities. None disables
    a function (no need to remove it / comment it out).

    (1) Hooks are only executed during dry-runs, if the class attribute
    :py:attr:`supports_dry_run` is set to `True` (default is `False`). Hooks
    with `supports_dry_run == True` must not modify LDAP objects.
    Therefore the LDAP connection object self.lo will be a read-only connection
    during a dry-run.
    (2) Read-write cn=admin connection in a real run, read-only cn=admin
    connection during a dry-run.
