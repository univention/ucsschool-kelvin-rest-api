Single source, partial import (SiSoPi) scenario
===============================================

The scenario in which a single source database for users in all schools exists, but the user import jobs will be run separately for each school, is supported since UCS\@school 4.3 v5 for both the command line and the HTTP-API import (via UMC module).

The documentation has been moved to the official UMC-import manual: https://docs.software-univention.de/ucsschool-umc-import-handbuch-4.4.html
