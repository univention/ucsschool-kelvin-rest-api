Architecture
============

System overview
---------------

* 🚧 What does the system look like from a bird's eye view?
* 🚧 Which external systems are involved (PostgreSQL, Guardian, Keycloak?, UDM REST, Provisioning service)?
* 🚧 How do the components interact?
* 🚧 C4 context diagram? (system within context)
* 🚧 C4 container diagram? (API, DB, Kelvin Connector, Provisioning Service, ...)

Components
----------

* 🚧 What layers are there (router, service, repository)?
* 🚧 What are the responsibilities of each layer?
* 🚧 What is the data flow for a typical request?

Data model
----------

* 🚧 What entities exist and how are they related?
* 🚧 What is the canonical data representation?

Architecture of Authentication & Authorization
----------------------------------------------

* 🚧 How does the auth flow work (API token? OIDC?)?
* 🚧 How are group memberships checked?
* 🚧 What roles/permissions are there?
* 🚧 Sequence diagram for auth flow

Interfaces
----------

* 🚧 Which protocols/formats are used?
* 🚧 What dependencies on external systems exist?
