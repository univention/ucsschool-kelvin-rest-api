Synchronisation to Nubus
========================

* Why is there a Kelvin connector?
* ...

Sync architecture
-----------------

* How is the sync service structured?
* Which interfaces of Nubus are used? (UDM REST, Provisioning service?)
* How is reliability ensured (retry, dead letter queue)?

Events
------

* What events are there (e.g., ``user created``, ``group changed``)?
* How is the event schema structured? Who produces, who consumes?

Conflict handling
-----------------

* What happens when simultaneous changes are made in both directions?
* What conflict resolution strategy applies (last write wins, merge, manual)?
* How are conflicts logged? How are customers notified?
