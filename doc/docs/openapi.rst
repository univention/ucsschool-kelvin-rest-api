OpenAPI / Swagger / ReDoc
=========================

Interactive API browser
-----------------------
The `UCS\@school Kelvin REST API` offers two web interfaces to explore the API graphically:

* The `Swagger`_ UI at ``https://<fqdn>/ucsschool/kelvin/v1/docs``
* The `ReDoc`_ UI at ``https://<fqdn>/ucsschool/kelvin/v1/redoc``

Both UIs are created in the browser by JavaScript code using the `OpenAPI`_ specification generated by the `UCS\@school Kelvin REST API` server.

The OpenAPI specification can be downloaded at: ``https://<fqdn>/ucsschool/kelvin/v1/openapi.json``.

The Swagger UI allows direct interaction (reading, creating users etc.) with the API server.
To use it, a token must first be retrieved by clicking the ``Authorize`` button in the top right corner.
In the pop-up, the username must be of a user in the group ``ucsschool-kelvin-rest-api-admins``.
The user ``Administrator`` is added to this group by default.
After supplying the password and clicking the ``Authorize`` button the pop-up can be closed.

Then methods of resources can be used.
After opening on one, a click on ``Try it out`` on the right side will allow to ``Execute`` the request.
